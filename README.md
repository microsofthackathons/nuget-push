# Simplify NuGet push!

This project is a prototype to make it easier to push packages... and way more secure too!

See this spec for more information: [NuGet.org login authentication workflow for dotnet nuget push](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/blob/f2251f43d164a8789e4e547efe3b0e518e4ff256/proposed/2021/NuGet-org-login-auth-for-dotnet-nuget-push.md)

## Device Flow authentication

[Device Flow](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Device-Code-Flow) prompts you to login by providing a link and a code:

> To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code ABC to authenticate.

The user opens their browser, navigates to the page, enters the code, and logs in using their Microsoft account. Once logged in, the app receives a token that can used to authenticate on behalf of the user.

### NuGet Demo

Prerequisites:

1. Make sure the NuGet server is on (it uses Azure free tier and turns off if there's no activity)
    1. Navigate to: https://loshar-auth-wus2.azurewebsites.net/
    1. Wait until the page loads...
1. Install the fake NuGet client: `dotnet tool install --global FakeGet --version 0.1.0`

Now push a package with interactive mode enabled:

```ps1
fakeget push <package.nupkg> -s https://loshar-auth-wus2.azurewebsites.net/v3/index.json --interactive
```

This will prompt you to login before uploading the package.
